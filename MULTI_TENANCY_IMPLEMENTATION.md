# Multi-Tenancy System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive multi-tenancy system where:
- **Parent Company** (`parent_comp = 'Yes'`) - Full system access
- **Customer Companies** (`parent_comp != 'Yes'`) - Limited access to their own data only

---

## 1. Backend Implementation

### A. Helper Class: `CompanyHelper.php`
**Location:** `app/Helpers/CompanyHelper.php`

**Key Methods:**
- `isCurrentCompanyParent()` - Check if logged-in user's company is parent
- `isCurrentCompanyCustomer()` - Check if logged-in user's company is customer
- `getAccessibleCompanies()` - Returns all companies for parent, own company for customers
- `getAccessibleLocations()` - Returns all locations for parent, own locations for customers
- `getAccessibleUsers()` - Returns all users for parent, own users for customers
- `applyCompanyFilter($query)` - Applies appropriate company filter to queries
- `canManageParentSettings()` - Check if user can access parent-only modules
- `getRestrictedFieldsForCustomer()` - Returns list of fields customer cannot edit

### B. Company Model Updates
**Location:** `app/Models/Company.php`

**Added Fields:**
- `parent_comp` - Identifies parent companies
- `default_currency_code` - Default currency

**Added Methods:**
- `isParentCompany()` - Boolean check
- `isCustomerCompany()` - Boolean check
- `scopeParent($query)` - Query scope for parent companies
- `scopeCustomer($query)` - Query scope for customer companies

---

## 2. Controller Implementations

### A. Company Controller
**Location:** `app/Http/Controllers/system/CompanyController.php`

**Changes:**
1. **Index**: Parent companies see ALL companies, customers see only their own
2. **Create/Edit**: Passes `isParentCompany` and `restrictedFields` to frontend
3. **Store**: Customer companies CANNOT set restricted fields
4. **Update**: 
   - Customer companies CANNOT update restricted fields
   - Customer companies can ONLY edit their own company
5. **Validation**: Restricted fields only validated for parent companies

**Restricted Fields for Customer Companies:**
- ❌ `parent_comp` (cannot change parent status)
- ❌ `package_id` (cannot change package)
- ❌ `license_number` (cannot change license)
- ❌ `license_start_date` (cannot change license dates)
- ❌ `license_end_date` (cannot change license dates)

### B. Location Controller
**Location:** `app/Http/Controllers/system/LocationController.php`

**Changes:**
- Added `checkAccess()` method that blocks customer companies
- Applied to all methods: index, create, store, edit, update, destroy, bulkUpdateStatus, bulkDestroy, updateSortOrder
- Returns 403 error: "Access Denied: Only parent companies can manage locations."

### C. Package Controller
**Location:** `app/Http/Controllers/system/PackageController.php`

**Changes:**
- Added `checkAccess()` method that blocks customer companies
- Applied to all methods: index, create, store, edit, update, destroy, bulkUpdateStatus, bulkDestroy, updateSortOrder
- Returns 403 error: "Access Denied: Only parent companies can manage packages."

## 3. Frontend Implementation

### Company Form
**Location:** `resources/js/Pages/system/Companies/Create.jsx`

**Changes:**
1. Added `isParentCompany` and `restrictedFields` props from backend
2. Added new fields:
   - `license_number`
   - `parent_comp` (dropdown: Yes/No)
3. **Field Filtering:** Automatically hides restricted fields for customer companies
4. Uses `filteredFields` instead of `companyFields` to render form

**Customer companies will NOT see:**
- Parent Company field
- Package selection
- License Number
- License Start/End Dates

---

## 4. Access Control Summary

### Parent Company Access ✅
- ✅ View/Edit ALL companies
- ✅ View/Edit ALL locations
- ✅ View/Edit ALL users
- ✅ Manage Packages
- ✅ Manage Package Features
- ✅ Manage Locations
- ✅ Configure Licenses
- ✅ Set parent_comp status

### Customer Company Access ❌
- ✅ View/Edit ONLY their own company (limited fields)
- ✅ View/Edit ONLY their own locations
- ✅ View/Edit ONLY their own users
- ❌ CANNOT access Packages module
- ❌ CANNOT access Package Features
- ❌ CANNOT access Locations module
- ❌ CANNOT change package_id
- ❌ CANNOT change license settings
- ❌ CANNOT change parent_comp status

---

## 5. Data Filtering

### Automatic Filtering Applied
All queries are automatically filtered using `CompanyHelper::applyCompanyFilter()`:

```php
// Parent Company: No filter (sees all)
// Customer Company: WHERE comp_id = {session.user_comp_id}
```

**Applied in:**
- Company listings
- Location listings (already per-company)
- User listings (already per-company)
- Report filters (needs to be added if not already done)
- All transaction queries (already using comp_id and location_id)

---

## 6. Security Measures

### Controller Level Protection
- All parent-only controllers use `checkAccess()` method
- Returns 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
- Prevents direct URL access

### Validation Level Protection
- Restricted fields use conditional validation
- Customer companies cannot submit restricted fields
- Backend strips out restricted fields before saving

### Frontend Level Protection
- Fields are hidden based on `isParentCompany` prop
- Form doesn't render restricted fields for customers
- Prevents accidental submission

## 7. Testing Checklist

### Parent Company Tests ✅
- [ ] Login as parent company
- [ ] View all companies in Companies list
- [ ] Create new customer company
- [ ] Edit any company
- [ ] Access Locations module
- [ ] Access Packages module
- [ ] Change package assignment
- [ ] Set license dates
- [ ] View all users across companies
- [ ] View all locations across companies

### Customer Company Tests ✅
- [ ] Login as customer company
- [ ] View ONLY own company in list
- [ ] Try to edit own company (should see limited fields)
- [ ] Verify cannot see: parent_comp, package_id, license fields
- [ ] Try to access Locations module (should get 403)
- [ ] Try to access Packages module (should get 403)
- [ ] View ONLY own users
- [ ] View ONLY own locations
- [ ] Try to edit another company (should get error)

### Security Tests ✅
- [ ] Try direct URL access to /system/locations (as customer)
- [ ] Try direct URL access to /system/packages (as customer)
- [ ] Try to submit restricted fields via API (as customer)
- [ ] Verify audit logs are created
- [ ] Verify all filters work correctly

## 8. Database Requirements

### Required Column
Ensure `companies` table has:
```sql
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN parent_comp VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'No';
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN default_currency_code VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'PKR';
```

---

## 9. Configuration

### Session Variables Used
- `user_comp_id` - Current user's company ID
- `user_location_id` - Current user's location ID
- `user_id` - Current user ID

### Helper Usage
```php
use App\Helpers\CompanyHelper;

// Check if parent company
if (CompanyHelper::isCurrentCompanyParent()) {
    // Parent company logic
}

// Get accessible companies
$companies = CompanyHelper::getAccessibleCompanies();

// Apply filter to query
$query = CompanyHelper::applyCompanyFilter($query);

// Check if can manage parent settings
if (CompanyHelper::canManageParentSettings()) {
    // Allow access
}
```

---

## 10. Next Steps (Optional)

### Menu System Integration
Update the menu/navigation system to:
- Hide Locations menu item for customer companies
- Hide Packages menu item for customer companies
- This can be done in the main layout/navigation component

### Report Filters
Ensure all reports use `CompanyHelper::applyCompanyFilter()` to filter data appropriately.

### API Endpoints
If you have API endpoints, apply the same access controls.
